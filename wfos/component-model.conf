description = """
The TCS provides telemetry streams to control several components of WFOS:

* **OIWFS probe arms**: The four arms are continuously positioned over guide stars.
* **ADC**:  The WFOS ADC will continuously update rotation for each prism and the separation between them based on TCS dispersion information.
* **rotator**: WFOS is rotated to compensate sidereal rotation and changes in pupil rotation, thus maintaining a stable scientific image.
