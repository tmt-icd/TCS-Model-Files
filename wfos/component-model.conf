description = """
The TCS provides telemetry streams to control several components of WFOS:

* **OIWFS probe arms**: The four arms are continuously positioned over guide stars.
* **ODGW positions**: Up to four on-detector guide windows are positioned over guide stars.
* **4 ADCs**: One for each OIWFS probe arm, and one for the science (for both Imager and IFS).
* **rotator**: WFOS is rotated to compensate sidereal rotation and changes in pupil rotation, thus maintaining a stable scientific image.
