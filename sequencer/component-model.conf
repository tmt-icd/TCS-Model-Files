There will be a single sequencer for TCS that is part of the TCS software package: the TCS Sequencer (TCS_SEQ). The TCS_SEQ is responsible for configuring the telescope systems, including the mount, enclosure, and mirrors systems, for carrying out observations, calibrations and engineering tasks.  The TCS_SEQ serves as the interface to the Executive Software (ESW) layer.
