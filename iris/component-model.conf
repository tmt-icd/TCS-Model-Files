description = """
The TCS provides telemetry streams to control several components of IRIS:

* **OIWFS probe arms**: The three arms are continuously positioned over guide stars.
* **ODGW positions**: Up to four on-detector guide windows are positioned over guide stars.
* **4 ADCs**: One for each OIWFS probe arm, and one for the science (for both Imager and IFS).
* **rotator**: IRIS is rotated to compensate sidereal rotation and changes in pupil rotation, thus maintaining a stable scientific image.
* **Cold Stop**: The cold stop masks out the thermal radiation from the telescope structure. The mask of the cold stop has to align with the telescope pupil.
