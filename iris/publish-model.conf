       The TCS publishes the IRIS imager dispersion information at the target telescope location.

       The entire event is published atomically so that all published subcomponents are synchronized.

       *Discussion: For sidereal tracking, the maximum rotation velocity of ADC prisms caused by the orientation change (= the change rate of the parallactic angle) is 0.225 deg/s, which happens when observing a target that transits 1 degree south from the zenith. The current required position accuracy is [+/- 0.28 deg](https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-57487/DN%20IRIS.IMG.ADC_REL01.pdf), so 1 Hz of update rate should be enough. If IRIS will need finer time granuality to frequently control the mechanisms, IRIS software should perform interpolation internally using the new event and the past events. If we really need to increase the update rate of this event in the future for better accuracy, there are two options: increase the update rate of this telemetry, or split "orientation" attribute into a separate event because the rotation velocity caused by the atmospheric correction is likely to be much slower than the velocity caused by the orientation change.*

       *Discussion: It is expected that this event is published two ticks (= 2 seconds in case the update rate of this event is 1 Hz) before the time indicated by "timestamp" attribute. This event shall be published, at least, one tick before the time indicated by "timestamp" attribute to allow IRIS to perform interpolation of "orientation". Considering the calculation time to perform interpolation and margin for communication & software delay, it should be one more tick before, hence two ticks in total.*

This is because the cold stop is inside the instrument, and the angle of the instrument rotator is a combination of parallactic angle and pupil rotation. The cold stop just needs to negate the parallactic angle caused by the insturment rotator. This value may include an offset if the observer has requested a particular zenith direction in the image.*

          *Discussion:  If we need to support pupil rotation tracking mode (= fixed pupil mode, or ADI mode) in the future, this value should be the zenith direction in the image specified by the observer. This should be fixed during the observation because the instrument rotator is supposed to compensate the pupil rotation.*
